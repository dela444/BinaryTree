# BinaryTree
C++ Binary Tree implementation with Iterators, subset checking and finding k-th largest element in tree.

This project implements a binary tree data structure in C++. It includes functionality for inserting elements, traversing the tree using iterators and reverse iterators and checking if one tree is a subset of another. Additionally, the project implements finding k-th largest element in tree using operator [].

Features:
- Binary tree data structure
- Iterators and reverse iterators for tree traversal
- Subset checking function
- Subscript operator [] for finding k-th largest element
